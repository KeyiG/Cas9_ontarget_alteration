This repositories contains scripts that used for the paper title: "Target-enriched nanopore sequencing and de novo assembly reveals co-occurrences of complex on-target genomic rearrangements induced by CRISPR/Cas9 in human cells"

The folder ChIP-seq contains scripts for analyzing ChIP-seq data. LRS contains the scripts for analyzing Xdrop-LRS data, including alignment, reads extraction, de novo assembly.

Xdrop_coverageplot.Rmd contains R script for processing and plotting coverage.

Pol3_readcounting_R.Rmd contains R script for normalising, applying cutoff and plotting the Pol III read count at target tRNA gene loci: tRNA-Cys-GCA-2-3 & tRNA-Cys-GCA-2-4.
